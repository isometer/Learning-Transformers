This repo is a crash course in the Transformer architecture and one application.

We'd like to build a transformer-based autoencoder that can identify and correct anomalies in physiological data.
We're currently using [this article](https://medium.com/@moussab.orabi/enable-transformers-with-anomaly-detection-in-high-order-multivariate-time-series-data-509a5df39151) as a guide, but we'll be looking elsewhere as needed.
